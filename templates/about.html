            <h6>Increases productivity</h6>
            <p>
                At work and at home, having a to-do list may help you prioritize your work and personal tasks. This allows you to organize and complete the most crucial tasks first. To-do lists can be used to improve time management because all of your tasks are laid out clearly in advance. You can more easily decide what to do after you complete a task and move on to the next item on the list.

            </p>
            <h6> Provides motivation</h6>
            <p>
                Too many tasks to remember can be overwhelming, but with the proper motivation, you can accomplish more and reduce stress. Having a to-do list makes it easier to organize everything that you want to accomplish in the day so that you can start fresh the next. Physically crossing items off a list can also increase motivation.
Being unmotivated can make you less likely to complete items on your to-do list. Finding intrinsic and extrinsic motivation is important. Intrinsic motivation is an internal source of encouragement. For example, a bookworm might finish a novel because they love reading and not because they have to do it for an assignment. Extrinsic motivation is an outside source that inspires you. An example of this is cleaning the house because coworkers are visiting for a business dinner. Thinking about your intrinsic and extrinsic sources of motivation can help you plan out how to complete tasks.
            </p>
            <h6>Improves memory</h6>
            <p>
                Creating and maintaining a daily to-do list can help improve your overall memory by reinforcing your short-term memory. By writing tasks and short-term goals and continually checking the list, you might retain more information. Making a list every day can improve memory and may assist you in making sure all your important tasks get completed on time.
